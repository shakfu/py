# py: a python3 external for max/msp

This project includes only the `py` external which is developed in the [py-js](https://github.com/shakfu/py-js.git) project.

This is just a brief experiment to develop it individually, and does not contain anything except the minimal requirement to do. If you are interested in this external or topic, you should visit the [py-js](https://github.com/shakfu/py-js.git) project for pre-compiled binaries and extensive documentation and examples.
